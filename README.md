# TIC_APPLICATION_PROJECT_KENEJUSTIN-IJEH_DATASCIENCE_AND_AI
My TIC Project for the Data Science and AI Stream

This project focuses on predicting student performance using multiple machine learning algorithms. The model compares several classifiers and optimizes the best-performing one to maximize accuracy and reliability. In the process of  making this model I integrated the use of preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization, forming a complete end-to-end ML pipeline.

The Objective of this project was to Accomplish a robust student performance prediction system , as measured by an improved model accuracy of 88.33% on unseen test data, by building, evaluating, and tuning multiple supervised learning models with optimized logistic regression parameters . I aslo Accomplished stability and interpretability, as measured by consistent classification results across random splits54, by utilizing controlled random seeds
